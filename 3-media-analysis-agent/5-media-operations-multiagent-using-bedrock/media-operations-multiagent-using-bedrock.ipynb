    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we'll build a sophisticated multi-agent system for media operations using the Strands Agents SDK. This system demonstrates the \"Agents as Tools\" pattern, where specialized agents work together to analyze media content, ensure compliance with standards, and generate appropriate metadata for different platforms.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What You'll Learn\n",
    "- How to implement the \"Agents as Tools\" pattern using Strands Agents SDK\n",
    "- How to create specialized agents with focused responsibilities\n",
    "- How to build a hierarchical agent system with a supervisor agent\n",
    "- How to leverage Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases for compliance checking\n",
    "- How to implement quality control in an agent workflow\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Concept: Agents as Tools\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Agents as Tools\" is an architectural pattern in AI systems where specialized AI agents are wrapped as callable functions (tools) that can be used by other agents. This creates a hierarchical structure where:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A primary \"orchestrator\" agent handles user interaction and determines which specialized agent to call\n",
    "- Specialized \"tool agents\" perform domain-specific tasks when called by the orchestrator\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach mimics human team dynamics, where a manager coordinates specialists, each bringing unique expertise to solve complex problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Our Multi-agent Architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we'll implement a media operations workflow with the following specialized agents:\n",

    "1. **Synopsis Agent**: Generates metadata based on video analysis and requirements\n",
    "2. **Compliance Analyzer**: Retrieves compliance requirements from a knowledge base\n",
    "3. **QC Agent**: Performs quality checks on the generated metadata\n",
    "4. **Supervisor Agent**: Orchestrates the entire workflow\n",

The clip features Detective Jake Sullivan investigating a series of mysterious disappearances of three divorced men near El Matador Beach. The only connection between these men is their divorced status and minimal criminal records.\\n\\nThe plot revolves around these strange disappearances and a witness account of seeing one of the victims standing on a distinctive rock formation at the shoreline before vanishing during an unnaturally sudden storm. In his place appeared a mysterious woman in a white dress with \"alabaster skin\" who seemed otherworldly.\\n\\nThe clip suggests that Detective Sullivan himself may have gone missing while investigating, as we see Captain Foster arriving at the El Matador location looking for him at the end of the scene.\\n\\nThe story appears to blend elements of noir detective drama with supernatural overtones.'\n",

    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we've demonstrated how to build a sophisticated multi-agent system for media operations using the Strands Agents SDK. We've implemented the \"Agents as Tools\" pattern to create a hierarchical system where specialized agents work together to accomplish complex tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Specialized Agents**: We created focused agents for compliance analysis, metadata generation, and quality control\n",
    "2. **Hierarchical Orchestration**: Our supervisor agent coordinated the workflow between specialized agents\n",
    "3. **Knowledge Integration**: We leveraged Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases to provide compliance information to our agents\n",
    "4. **Iterative Refinement**: Our system implemented a feedback loop where metadata is improved based on QC feedback\n",
    "\n",
    "The Strands Agents SDK provides a powerful framework for building complex multi-agent systems that can tackle real-world problems through collaboration and specialization."
