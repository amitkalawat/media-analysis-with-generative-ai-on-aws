One of these guys was a school teacher. Next guy, he sold insurance, and the last guy, he was retired. Any connection? Mm. I mean, I checked them all out. There's no criminal records, no association in any criminal organizations. One of the guys was arrested for drunk driving a long time ago. They were all divorced.\\n\\n[spk_2]: Well, in that case, maybe you don't want to go out there, boss.\\n\\n[spk_1]: What are you, a comedian? If that's the case, you sure don't want to go out there.\\n\\n[spk_2]: Yeah, look, I know what happened, all right? They go out to the rock, they take that long, cold, slow swim to\\n\\n[spk_1]: China. Suicide.\\n\\n[spk_2]: It's been known to happen out there.\\n\\n[spk_1]: Uh, not this time. What do you mean? Well, for one thing, there's no bodies, and Somebody was out there the day the last guy disappeared.\\n\\n[spk_2]: A witness,\\n\\n[spk_1]: yeah, a witness.\\n\\n[spk_2]: Why didn't you say that in the first place?\\n\\n[spk_1]: Because I thought the guy was nuts, what he said.\\n\\n[spk_2]: But now you believe him.\\n\\n[spk_1]: I had him checked out too. The guy's a goddamn Eagle Scout. So now, now I don't know what to believe. I know I don't want to believe him.\\n\\n[spk_2]: What did he say?\\n\\n[spk_1]: He said he was out there walking his dog along the bluffs above El Matador, right? And he looks down at the beach at that huge rock, you know, the one that's separated from the mainland right where the ocean meets the shore. His words looks like a, like a mythic sea creature, you know that one. Anyway, he looks down there and there's a guy who's on top of that rock, and he's thinking to himself, how the hell do you get up there? You gotta be a goddamn mountain climber. But more importantly, he says the guy's acting really funny. He's looking all over that rock like he's looking for something or someone. At that very moment, he says it got really, really dark, really fast, and bombs start going off in the air, thunder and lightning, weather like he'd never seen before coming from he didn't know where. When he looks back at the rock, the guy's gone. But there's a woman there. She's in a white dress, alabaster skin, his words, and he says she's staring right up at him. He sees her, she's beautiful. But like she's from some other time, some other place. He looks back at the weather cause it's getting worse and worse. He decides to hightail it out of there. And that was it. That was his story, right? [spk_1]: So now Now I need you to go up there and find that woman. [spk_0]: So these guys just disappear.\\n\\n[spk_1]: No, not this time. Somebody was out there the day the last guy disappeared. A witness, yeah, a witness. He said that he was up there walking his dog along those bluffs above El Matador, and there's a guy who's on top of that rock. He's just like looking all over the rock as if he's looking for someone or something. Then it gets dark all of a sudden, really fast. Like thunder and lightning from everywhere, all this weather. When he looks back at the rock, the guy's gone, but there's a woman there in a long white dress with alabaster skin. And she's staring right up at him, not moving. Now I don't know what to [spk_1]: I know I sure don't want to believe him.   [spk_3]: Yeah, dispatch. This is Captain Foster. I'm out here at the El Matador location. There's no sign of Detective Sullivan. Now what's this car. Listen, I'm gonna take a look around before you send anybody out here, so. Hang on a minute.\\n\\n[spk_4]: Captain Foster, [spk_4]: you come in please. Captain Foster I. LAPD, put your hands in the air. Put your hands up now. Hm    \",\n",

The cases share an eerie connection to a distinctive rock formation where the ocean meets the shore, described as resembling a mythic sea creature.\\n\\nThe investigation reveals that unlike previous incidents in the area, which were associated with mob activity under Mickey Cohen, these disappearances involve seemingly ordinary men - a school teacher, an insurance salesman, and a retiree. The only common thread among them is that they were all divorced, with minimal criminal history aside from one old DUI case.\\n\\nWhile some suggest suicide as an explanation, the absence of bodies and a credible witness account points to something more mysterious. The witness, described as a trustworthy \"Eagle Scout,\" reported a disturbing incident while walking his dog along the bluffs above El Matador. He observed a man peculiarly searching the large rock formation, apparently looking for something or someone. Suddenly, unprecedented weather conditions emerged - darkness fell rapidly, accompanied by thunder and lightning.\\n\\nWhen the witness looked back at the rock, the man had vanished. In his place stood a woman in a white dress with alabaster skin, described as beautiful but otherworldly, as if from another time and place. She was seen staring directly at the witness before he fled from the intensifying storm. This testimony, though initially dismissed as outlandish, has become a crucial element in understanding these unexplained disappearances.',\n",

One of these guys was a school teacher. Next guy, he sold insurance, and the last guy, he was retired. Any connection? Mm. I mean, I checked them all out.
