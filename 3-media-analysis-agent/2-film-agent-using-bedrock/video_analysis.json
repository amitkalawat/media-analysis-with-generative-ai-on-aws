  "visual_summary": "In a mysterious series of disappearances along a stretch of road above El Matador beach, three men with seemingly no connection to each other have vanished without a trace. The only commonality between the victims - a schoolteacher, an insurance salesman, and a retiree - was that they were all divorced men with minimal criminal records.\n\nWhile some suggest suicide as an explanation, Detective Sullivan dismisses this theory due to the absence of bodies. The case takes an intriguing turn when a credible witness, described as 'a goddamn Eagle Scout,' comes forward with an unusual account of the most recent disappearance. The witness was walking his dog along the bluffs when he spotted a man atop a distinctive rock formation at the shoreline - one that resembles a mythic sea creature and appears nearly impossible to climb.\n\nAccording to the witness, the man on the rock appeared to be searching for something or someone when suddenly, the area was engulfed by an unnaturally rapid darkness accompanied by severe thunder and lightning. When the witness looked back at the rock, the man had vanished. In his place stood a woman in a white dress with alabaster skin, described as beautiful but otherworldly, who stared directly at the witness. As the weather continued to worsen, the witness fled the scene.\n\nThe investigation continues with Detective Sullivan sending someone to locate this mysterious woman, while Captain Foster later arrives at the El Matador location searching for Detective Sullivan, who has apparently gone missing as well. The case remains unresolved as Captain Foster discovers an unexpected vehicle at the scene and decides to investigate before calling for backup.",
  "audio_transcription": "   [spk_0]: So these guys just disappeared. [spk_1]: Yeah, on that stretch of road right above El Matador. You know it. With the big rock, that's right,\n\n[spk_2]: yeah. You know, Mickey Cohen used to take his associates out there, get him a bond voyage.\n\n[spk_1]: Mob heads? No, not this time. One of these guys was a school teacher. Next guy, he sold insurance, and the last guy, he was retired. Any connection? Mm. I mean, I checked them all out. There's no criminal records, no association in any criminal organizations. One of the guys was arrested for drunk driving a long time ago. They were all divorced.\n\n[spk_2]: Well, in that case, maybe you don't want to go out there, boss.\n\n[spk_1]: What are you, a comedian? If that's the case, you sure don't want to go out there.\n\n[spk_2]: Yeah, look, I know what happened, all right? They go out to the rock, they take that long, cold, slow swim to\n\n[spk_1]: China. Suicide.\n\n[spk_2]: It's been known to happen out there.\n\n[spk_1]: Uh, not this time. What do you mean? Well, for one thing, there's no bodies, and Somebody was out there the day the last guy disappeared.\n\n[spk_2]: A witness,\n\n[spk_1]: yeah, a witness.\n\n[spk_2]: Why didn't you say that in the first place?\n\n[spk_1]: Because I thought the guy was nuts, what he said.\n\n[spk_2]: But now you believe him.\n\n[spk_1]: I had him checked out too. The guy's a goddamn Eagle Scout. So now, now I don't know what to believe. I know I don't want to believe him.\n\n[spk_2]: What did he say?\n\n[spk_1]: He said he was out there walking his dog along the bluffs above El Matador, right? And he looks down at the beach at that huge rock, you know, the one that's separated from the mainland right where the ocean meets the shore. His words looks like a, like a mythic sea creature, you know that one. Anyway, he looks down there and there's a guy who's on top of that rock, and he's thinking to himself, how the hell do you get up there? You gotta be a goddamn mountain climber. But more importantly, he says the guy's acting really funny. He's looking all over that rock like he's looking for something or someone. At that very moment, he says it got really, really dark, really fast, and bombs start going off in the air, thunder and lightning, weather like he'd never seen before coming from he didn't know where. When he looks back at the rock, the guy's gone. But there's a woman there. She's in a white dress, alabaster skin, his words, and he says she's staring right up at him. He sees her, she's beautiful. But like she's from some other time, some other place. He looks back at the weather cause it's getting worse and worse. He decides to hightail it out of there. And that was it. That was his story, right? [spk_1]: So now Now I need you to go up there and find that woman. [spk_0]: So these guys just disappear.\n\n[spk_1]: No, not this time. Somebody was out there the day the last guy disappeared. A witness, yeah, a witness. He said that he was up there walking his dog along those bluffs above El Matador, and there's a guy who's on top of that rock. He's just like looking all over the rock as if he's looking for someone or something. Then it gets dark all of a sudden, really fast. Like thunder and lightning from everywhere, all this weather. When he looks back at the rock, the guy's gone, but there's' a woman there in a long white dress with alabaster skin. And she's staring right up at him, not moving. Now I don't know what to [spk_1]: I know I sure don't want to believe him.   [spk_3]: Yeah, dispatch. This is Captain Foster. I'm out here at the El Matador location. There's no sign of Detective Sullivan. Now what's this car. Listen, I'm gonna take a look around before you send anybody out here, so. Hang on a minute.\n\n[spk_4]: Captain Foster, [spk_4]: you come in please. Captain Foster I. LAPD, put your hands in the air. Put your hands up now. Hm",
