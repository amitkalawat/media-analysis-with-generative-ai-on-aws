Title: Meridian (Short 2016)

Storyline: In 1947 Los Angeles, veteran detective Mac Foster talks with his younger partner Jake Sullivan about the disappearance of three men near a rock overlooking a beach. Mac explains that the three had no connection to one another, except that they were all divorced. He also mentions there was a witness to the last disappearance who had described supernatural goings-on.

At Mac's behest, Jake drives to the scene. On the way, it begins to rain. Through his rearview mirror, he notices a woman sitting in his back seat; when he turns to look, the seat is empty. Later, Mac finds Jake's car, abandoned, near the rock, and a storm rapidly rolls in. Mac wanders from the car and across the beach, entering a large cave.

Inside the cave is a ventriloquist's dummy, a clock whose numbers appear to rotate, a stained-glass window, and footage of Mac himself projected onto the wall. He then comes across the three missing men, as well as Jake, frozen still. The woman appears again, behind Mac, as the film ends.
