    "# Ad break detection and contextual Ad targeting\n",
    "\n",
    "Contextual advertising is a form of targeted advertising where the advertisement is matched to the context of the webpage or media being consumed by the user. This process involves three key players: the publisher (website or content owner), the advertiser, and the consumer. Publishers provide the platform and content, while advertisers create ads tailored to the context. Consumers engage with the content, and relevant ads are displayed based on the context, creating a more personalized and relevant advertising experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Ad decisions](./static/images/02-ad-decisions.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "A challenging area of contextual advertising is inserting ads in media content for streaming on video on demand (VOD) platforms. This process traditionally relied on manual tagging, where human experts analyzed the content, identified breaks in the narrative and assigned relevant keywords or categories. However, this approach is time-consuming, subjective, and may not capture the full context or nuances of the content. Traditional AI/ML solutions can automate this process, but they often require extensive training data and can be expensive and limited in their capabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "Generative AI, powered by large language models, offers a promising solution to this challenge. By leveraging the vast knowledge and contextual understanding of these models, publishers can automatically generate contextual insights and taxonomies for their media assets. This approach streamlines the process and provides accurate and comprehensive contextual understanding, enabling effective ad targeting and monetization of media archives.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you are done with this part of the workshop, you'll have created the following metadata for a video:\n",
    "* a list of high quality ad placement opportunities  or _breaks_ available in the video\n",
    "* contextual information for the video before and after each break, including classification using the IAB Content Taxonomy that is used by advertisers to classify content for automated placement using Ad Decision Servers."

    "In the [Video segmentation notebook](video-understanding-with-generative-ai-on-aws-main/01-video-time-segmentation.ipynb), we have separately processed the visual and audio cues from the video. Now, we will do one more step to bring them together and ensure that the transcription topics align with the scenes. The last thing you want is to insert an ad during an ongoing conversation or scene. To create alignment, we will iterate over each conversational topic, represented by its start and end timestamps, and a text description summarizing the topic. For each topic, the code identifies the relevant video scenes that overlap or fall within the topic's timestamp range. The output of this process is a list of chapters, where each chapter contains a list of scene IDs representing the video scenes that align with the corresponding audio conversation. After the alignment process, we have combined visual and audio cues into the final chapters. The breaks between chapters are ideal places for ad insertion because they occur between contextual changes in the content of the video. \n",

From our testing, these models have demonstrated the ability to capture minute details from large images and follow image sequences when provided with appropriate instructions.\n",

    "To prepare the input for Claude3 Sonnet, we first assemble video frames associated with each topic and create a composite image grid. Through our experimentation, we have found that the optimum image grid ratio is 7 rows by 4 columns, which will assemble a 1568 x 1540 pixel image that fits under Claude's 5 MB image file size limit while still preserving enough detail in each individual frame tile. Furthermore, you can also assemble multiple images if needed.\n",

    "Subsequently, the composite images, the transcription, the IAB Content taxonomy definitions, and GARM taxonomy definitions are fed into the prompt to generate descriptions, sentiment, IAB taxonomy, GARM taxonomy, and other relevant information in a single query to the Claude3 Haiku model. Not only that, but we can adapt this approach to any taxonomy or custom labeling use cases without the need to train a model each time. This is where the true power of this approach lies. The final output can be presented to a human reviewer for final confirmation if needed. Here is an example of a composite image grid and the corresponding contextual output for a specific topic.\n",
